# segment-tree

This crate contains various data structures useful for quickly performing
interval queries or modifications in some array.

The data structures in this crate are all trees. The trees are represented using
an array for high performance and low memory usage.  Despite the name of the
crate, not every tree in this crate is a segment tree.
